2014-2015 Stats Available
=========================

The 2014-2015 season is underway and like last year you can find your
advanced DBL stats in our :ref:`downloads` section. 
You can still use Excel to do your own analysis,
as described in :ref:`using-excel-for-analysis`.
This year, we provide some pre-configured Excel files; see :ref:`downloads`.

Feel free to contact me (see :ref:`about` for contact details) if you have any questions or suggestions.
