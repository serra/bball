Team totals csv file added
==========================

I have added a csv file to the output directory that calculates totals per team
for the basic box score data, offensive ratings, defensive ratings, net ratings 
and four factors for the team an their opponents.

See the "*team_totals.csv" files in our :ref:`downloads` section.
