Evaluating Individual Scoring Efficiency
========================================

To evaluate a team's scoring efficiency by its players,
I like to compare:

 * how often a player is used in absolute terms offensively (median of the player's finishes)
 * how often a player is used in relative terms (median of the player's usage)
 * how efficient a player is scoring-wise (player's points per play)
 * player's playing time

I find the following chart useful to graph this:

Many low-impact players around team efficiency average - 
everybody appears to know what to do offensively.

Two outstanding players (Holcomb-Faye and Givens).
Holcomb Faye is outstanding in terms of finishes (many assists, 37% assist ratio) 
and keeps his usage at team average to compensate for his low scoring efficiency.
Givens is outstanding in that he combines high usage with high scoring efficiency.


EBBC, 2012-2013 season:

All high impact players score at about team average efficiency, 
which makes it hard for opponents to focus there defensive attention.
