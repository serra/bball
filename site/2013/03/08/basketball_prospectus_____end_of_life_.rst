Basketball Prospectus ... end of life?
======================================

Apparently, Kevin Pelton, Bradford Doolittle, and John Gasaway 
`have left basketball Prospectus <http://www.basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2545>`_ 
and are now writing for ESPN insider.

That's a shame ... I liked them in my geeky, sporty corner of the internet that basketball prospectus had been for me.
But I guess I'll have to change the sweet, late-nineties styled 
`Basketball Prospectus <http://www.basketballprospectus.com/>`_ with it's iconic yellow banner ("Click Here to Subscribe Today!")
for the horrible, flashy `ESPN Insider <http://insider.espn.go.com/insider/benefits#nba>`_ with "Exclusive Rumors".
