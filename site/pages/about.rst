About
=====

Hi, I'm Marijn van der Zee. 
I'm a freelance software developer and basketball coach
with a love for performance analysis in basketball.

I've created some programs (in R)
that use the publicly available box score statistics from the DBL
to calculate some advanced performance indicators for both players and teams.
These performance indicators are available for :ref:`download here <downloads>`.


You contact me on `Github <http://www.github.com>`_ 
where I'm known as `serra <https://github.com/serra>`_.

If you'd like to hire me to do some software development or consultancy,
please refer to `www.serraict.com <http://www.serraict.com/contact>`_.
My professional expertise is in the field 
of automation and IT solutions in glasshouse horticulture,
but I'm interested in basketball related projects too.
